## Community

#### Open source contributions

TODO sebastian

#### Current scaling use cases we track

TODO: nebojsa? include this? or only Hypix (as the new thing)?

- Hypix - productized hydraw
- Book.io - scalable minting and distribution of tokenized books
- Midnight - dust airdrop and side-chain operatio
- SingularityNet - pay-per-use API / Cardano port of an existing Ethereum solution
- SundaeLabs - scaling their DEX using gummiworm / hydra ledger-only as validators
- Emurgo/Obsidian - general interest in creating a payment channel network
