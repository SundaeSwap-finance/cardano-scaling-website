This report summarizes the work on Hydra since October 2023. It serves as
preparation for the monthly review meeting (see [slides][slides] and
[recording][recording]), where the team updates project stakeholders on recent
developments to gather their feedback on proposed plans.

## Roadmap

This month, several items were restructured on the project
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7):

![The roadmap with features and ideas](./img/2023-11-roadmap.jpg) <small><center>The latest roadmap with features and ideas</center></small>

#### Notable updates

- Release of version `0.14.0` imminent as most of the [stateless chain
  observation #1096](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1096)
  feature is done and only some internal refactoring missing.

- Refined user submitted feature idea on supporting extended keys
  [#1141](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1141). The purpose
  (why?) of this item is clear now and work can be started (it's not a priority
  still though).

- Two new items were created to improve developer experience of the [hydra build
  toolchain #1146](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1146) and a
  follow-up on things learned by `hydra-poll` to create a full end-to-end
  example of a [2-player game in a hydra head
  #1098](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1098).

- There was already an item about reacting to mainchain parameter changes on the
  roadmap, which included not only protocol parameter updates, but also
  hard-fork events. With the upcoming hard-fork into `Conway`, we split off the
  changes needed to navigate such hard-fork and concretized it:
  
  + [Conway support #1177](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1177) will make the `hydra-node` support Conway and allow users to keep heads open across the hard-fork.
  + [Drop Babbage support #1178](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1178) will eventually make us drop support for the Babbage era and retain maintainability.
  + The original item is only about [reacting to protocol parameter changes #195](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/195) now.

- Substantial updates on the design of the next major feature [Incremental decommit #1057](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/1057) and work can be started on this item.

- In general we prepared prepared multiple of these ðŸ’­ idea items and many of them will turn into ðŸ’¬ features soon.
