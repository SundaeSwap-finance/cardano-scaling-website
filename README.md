# Building

The user-manual is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which combines React components and markdown into a customisable static website.

#### Installation

```console
$ yarn
```

#### Local Development

```console
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

#### Build

```console
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
