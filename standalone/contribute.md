# Contribute to Hydra

### *Run* the hydra demo

See Hydra in action by following [these instructions](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/getting-started/demo/).

### *Tell* us about your use cases

Are you building on Cardano already? Could hydra help you scale? We have set up a survey to learn more and [gather feedback](https://input-output.typeform.com/to/QGzB0Q03).

### *Review* the lightpapers

We are exploring use cases and how to empower them with Hydra ourselves and with our partners. Check out the [use cases section](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/use-cases) and the [Hydra for Payments light paper](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/11/10/hydra-for-payments-introducing-developer-tooling-to-unlock-micropayments-on-cardano/).

### *Comment* on the roadmap

Our development roadmap is public [on Github](https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7). If you have questions or an item is of special interest to your team, leave a comment or start a new [discussion](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/discussions).
