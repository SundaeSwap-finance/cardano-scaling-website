# Topologies

Hydra Head is a well-defined Layer 2 consensus protocol as explained in the [Core Concepts](../index) page, but this is not the end of the story and does not really define _how_ to use this protocol and what _topologies_ are possible. By _topologies_ we mean here how the various ways in which Hydra Nodes, eg. the actual software implementing the protocol, can be interconnected.

As more users implement solutions on top of Hydra, this "catalog" of topologies shall expand to help newcomers find and build the right deployment model, eg. the one that suits best their use case.
