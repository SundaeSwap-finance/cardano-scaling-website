Draft

## Context

* Currently the `hydra-node` maintains two pieces of state during the life-cycle of a Hydra Head:
  1. A `HeadState tx` provided by the `HydraHead tx m` handle interface and part of the `Hydra.Node` module. It provides the basis for the main `hydra-node` business logic in `Hydra.Node.processNextEvent` and `Hydra.HeadLogic.update`
  [Creation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Node.hs#L256-L257), [Usage](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Node.hs#L174)
  2. `SomeOnChainHeadState` is kept in the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` to keep track of the latest known head state, including notable transaction outputs and information how to spend it (e.g. scripts and datums)
  [Code](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L156-L162), [Usage 1](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L449), [Usage 2](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L414), [Usage 3](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L349-L352)
  (There are other unrelated things kept in memory like the event history in the API server or a peer map in the network heartbeat component.)
* The interface between the `Hydra.Node` and a `Hydra.Chain` component consists of 
  - constructing certain Head protocol transactions given a description of it (`PostChainTx tx`):
    ```hs
    postTx :: MonadThrow m => PostChainTx tx -> m ()
    ```
  - a callback function when the `Hydra.Chain` component observed a new Head protocol transaction described by `OnChainTx tx`:
    ```hs
    type ChainCallback tx m = OnChainTx tx -> m ()
    ```
* Given by the usage sites above, the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` module requires additional info to do both, construct protocol transactions with `postTx` as well as observe potential `OnChainTx` ([here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/a98e2907c4e425de2736782793383aad63132c14/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Chain/Direct.hs#L333-L336)). Hence we see that, operation of the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` component (and likely any implementing the interface fully) is **inherently stateful**.
* We are looking at upcoming features to [handle rollbacks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/185) and dealing with [persisting the head state](https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/issues/187).
  - Both could benefit from the idea, that the `HeadState` is just a result of pure `Event` processing (a.k.a event sourcing).
  - Right now the `HeadState` kept in `Hydra.Node` alone, is not enough to fully describe the state of the `hydra-node`. Hence it would not be enough to just persist all the `Event`s and replaying them to achieve persistence, nor resetting to some previous `HeadState` in the presence of a rollback.

## Decision

* We define and keep a "blackbox" `ChainState tx` in the `HeadState tx`
  - It shall not be introspectable to the business logic in `HeadLogic`
  - It shall contain chain-specific information about the current Hydra Head, which will naturally need to evolve once we have multiple Heads in our feature scope

* We provide the latest `ChainState tx` to `postTx` by extending `PostChainTx tx`
* We change the callback interface of `Chain` to
```hs
type ChainCallback tx m = (ChainState tx -> Maybe (OnChainTx tx)) -> m ()
```
with the meaning, that invoking the callback indicates receival of a potential Hydra transaction which is `Maybe` observing a relevant `OnChainTx tx`.
* We also extend `OnChainTx tx` with a `ChainState tx` to allow for state updates when observing.

## Consequences

* We need to change the construction of `Chain` handles and the call sites of `postTx`
* We need to change the interface between `Hydra.Chain.Direct.Tx` and `Hydra.Chain.Direct.State` to something else than `OnChainTx` as the former would not have a suitble `ChainState` to construct (see example)
* We need to extract the state handling (similar to the event queue) out of the `HydraNode` handle and shuffle the main of `hydra-node` a bit to be able to provide the latest `ChainState` to the chain callback as a continuation.
* We need to make the `ChainState` already serializable (`ToJSON`, `FromJSON`) as it's part of the `PostChainTx` and `OnChainTx` types.
* We can drop the `TVar` of keeping `OnChainHeadState` in the `Hydra.Chain.Direct` module, which should simplify the code
* Traces (e.g. `ToPost`) and errors (e.g. `PostTxError`) would include the full `ChainState`, which might be helpful but also possible big
* We might be able to simplify the `ChainState tx` to be just a `UTxOType tx` later

## To be discussed

* Alternative: We could not extend `PostChainTx` and `OnChainTx` with `ChainState`, but passing it as additional argument to `postTx` and returning a tuple in `ChainCallback`, i.e.
```hs
postTx :: MonadThrow m => ChainState tx -> PostChainTx tx -> m ()
type ChainCallback tx m = (ChainState tx -> Maybe (OnChainTx tx, ChainState tx)) -> m ()
```
  + this requires adding `ChainState` to the `OnChainEvent` "outside" of the already included `OnChainTx`, which has also a rippling effect.
  + this makes it non-obvious that the `ChainState` should be threaded through the `HeadLogic` and one would be inclined to retrieve / update the `chainState` in the callback (Main) and effect handling. which we should avoid IMO as it would mean more logic at the edges.
  + this then implies that also `ChainEffect` needs to be updated correspondingly, ending up in a very similar situation to the above (with slightly less ripple into the `Chain` component)
