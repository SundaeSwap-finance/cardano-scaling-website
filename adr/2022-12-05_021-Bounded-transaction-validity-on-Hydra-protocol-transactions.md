## Status

Proposed

## Context

- The HydraHeadV1 formal specification contains a _bounded confirmation window_:

  ```
  // Deadline

  T_max <= T_min + L // Bounded confirmation window
  DLâ€™ = T_max + L    // The latest possible deadline is 2*L

  ```

  with `T_min` and `T_max` being the tx validity bounds and `L` being the contestation period.

  - This is to avoid attacks with specified upper validity bound being too far in the future and denial of service the head with this (e.g. 10 years).

#### Current state of things:

- The contestation period and upper tx validity is used for computing the contestation deadline.

- There is a `closeGraceTime` currently hard-coded (to `100` slots) to set some upper bound on the `closeTx`. This was also required so far to compute the contestation deadline.

- Different networks (chains) have different slot lenghts, e.g. the preview network has a slot every `1s`, while our local devnets use `0.1s`. This means hardcoded values
  like `closeGraceTime` need to be _in sync_ with the underlying network.

- The `contestationPeriod` can be configured by users via the `Init` client input. For example, the hydra-cluster test suite uses a hardcoded `cperiod` on the client side.

- Default value for `T_Min` is negative infinity.

- Lower tx validity being in the future does not pose a problem since other participant is able to close a head.

#### What we want to achieve:

- We want to enforce topmost formula in this file in our code on-chain.

- The time between close transaction and when a fanout transaction can be posted should be _at most_ `2*contestationPeriod`. Users need to know this.

- The contestation period is to be used to create bounded close transaction. Before it was only used for computing the contestation deadline. One consequence is that
  if `contestationPeriod` is low our txs reach the upper bound fast and become invalid. That is why we set the upper tx bound to be `contestationPeriod * 2` so
  that txs have high enough upper bound.

- Make sure all head participants use the same value for `contestationPeriod`.

- Attack vector has a corresponding mutation test.

## Decision

- Use the specification formula on-chain.
- Configure the contestation period (number of seconds) on the `hydra-node`, e.g. via a `--contestation-period` command line option.
- Lower tx bound should be the last known slot as reported by the `cardano-node`.
- Upper tx bound is the current slot + `contestationPeriod * 2`.
- When submitting the `InitTx` make sure to use `--contestation-period` value.
- If other nodes observe `OnInitTx` and the `contestationPeriod` value does not match with their `--contestation-period` setting - ignore `InitTx`.
- Remove `closeGraceTime`

## Consequences

- Not any positive number of seconds is a valid contestation period any more!
- All parties need to aggree on contestation period before trying to run a Head protocol otherwise
  InitTx will be ignored.
- Upper tx bound is `contestationPeriod * 2` which should be good enough value considering `contestationPeriod` needs to be _in sync_
  with the current network.
