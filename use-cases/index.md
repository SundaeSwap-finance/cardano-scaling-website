# Use Cases

In this section, you'll find example use cases and user-stories about Hydra heads. At this stage, this is mostly how we envision people using Hydra or what we think can be valid use cases. We hope that this not only helps readers understand a bit more the pros and cons of using Hydra heads as a layer 2 solution, but we hope it may also inspire projects and new use cases!

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useDocsSidebar} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useDocsSidebar().filter(({ docId }) => docId != "index")}/>
```
