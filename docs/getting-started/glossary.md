# Glossary

### Contestation Period
The time window between closing the head and `fan out` allowed to `contest`.


### Hydra Head
A running instance of the hydra head protocol. See a reference in [essential cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/glossary/hydra-head) for more details.


### Hydra Network
One or more hydra nodes inter-connected.


### Hydra Node
Essential building block and executable piece of software that is used to form a [hydrahead network.


### Isomorphic
Reuses the existing smart contract system and code for offchain computations. This guarantees that onchain and offchain semantics coincide, leading to significant engineering simplifications.


### Layer 2
Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. See this [page](../../core-concepts/layer-two) for more details.


### Marker Datum
Its a [datum](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#datum) used for the sole purpose of identifying a [UTxO](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#utxo)


### Participation Token
An on-chain token entitling a party with the right to participate in the hydra head.


### Party
A participant or logical member of the head network, identified by a pair of verification keys one for hydra and another one for cardano.


### Peer
A member of the head network, identified by an IP address and a TCP port.


### Protocol Fuel
A single [UTxO](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#utxo) used to pay for hydra head [transaction](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#transaction) [fees](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#fee)


### Reference script
See this [page](./quickstart#reference-scripts) for more details.


### Rollback
Is actually a fork, and its a multi-step process between the head and L1. See this [page](../../core-concepts/rollbacks) for more details.


### Signing key
See a reference in [cardano glossary](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#keypair) for more details.


### Snapshot
Some state of a hydra head multi signed by all parties.


### State Channel
See this [page](../../core-concepts/layer-two#state-channels) for more details.


### State Thread Token
An on-chain token representing the state of a hydra head.


### Verification Key
See a reference in [cardano glossary](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary/#keypair) for more details.
