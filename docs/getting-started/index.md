# Getting Started

:::warning Mainnet Availability
Since version 0.10.0, Hydra scripts are available on Cardano mainnet
and it's therefore possible to run Hydra nodes on mainnet.  Before
doing so, be sure to review the [relevant section](/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting) of the
documentation in order to understand the current limitations and the
possible consequences.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
